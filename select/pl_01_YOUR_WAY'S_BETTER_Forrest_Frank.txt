When I'm overwhelmed within
From the weight of all my sin
I need a friend to call my own
I need a house to call my home
When I'm broken down inside
And there's nowhere else to hide
I need a place
where I feel known
Can someone help me?
Then I hear Your reply
Bringin' teardrops to my eyes
Sayin' I'm not alone
Oh, Lord, I need You now
more than ever
Would You put my heart
back together?
I searched the world
till my head hurt
Just to find out Your way's
better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus, Your way's better
Lord, I am so thankful for the
ways that You blessed me
Everything You say makin'
waves like a jet ski
You love every part of me,
even when I was messy
Now I see the heart
in Your beauty,
so I can finally sing out
Jehovah Jireh, Provider
Your way always gets me higher
Even on my darkest days,
You're a lighter
My Messiah
Oh, Lord, I need You now
more than ever
Would you put my heart
back together?
I searched the world
till my head hurt
Just to find out Your way's
better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus, mmm
Lord, I need You now
more than ever
Would You put my heart
back together?
I searched the world
till my head hurt
Just to find out Your way's
better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus, Your way's better
Woah-woah-oh, Your way's better
Woah-woah-oh, Your way's better
Woah-woah-oh, Your way's better
(Jesus, Your way's better) mmm
it's better, better, better
it's better, better, better
it's better, better, better
it's better than the rest
