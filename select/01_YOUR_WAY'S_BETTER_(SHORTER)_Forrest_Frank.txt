Oh Lord, I need You now more than ever
Would You put my heart back together
I searched the world 'til my head hurt
Just to find out Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus, Your way's better
Lord, I am so thankful for the ways that You blessed me
Everything You say making waves like a jet ski
You love every part of me, even when I was messy
Now I see the heart in Your beauty
So, I can finally sing Jehovah-Jireh provider
Your way always gets me higher
Even on my darkest days, You're a lighter
My Messiah
Oh Lord, I need You now more than ever
Would You put my heart back together?
I searched the world 'til my head hurt
Just to find out Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus (mmm)
Lord, I need You now more than ever
Would You put my heart back together
I searched the world 'til my head hurt
Just to find out Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Jesus, Your way's better
It's better, better, better (oh-oh, Your way's better)
It's better, better, better (oh-oh, Your way's better)
It's better, better, better (oh-oh, Your way's better)
It's better than the rest (oh-oh, Your way's better)
